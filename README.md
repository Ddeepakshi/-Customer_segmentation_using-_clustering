Customer Segmentation & Lookalike Model 📊

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation & Lookalike Model project! 🎉 In this project, we analyze customer profiles, build a lookalike model to find similar customers, and perform clustering for targeted customer segmentation. 🔍

🚀 Project Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on customer and transaction data, building a Lookalike Model to recommend similar customers, and using Clustering techniques to segment customers for personalized marketing strategies.

📁 Project Structure

Here’s an overview of the files included in this repository:


EDA

Deepakshi_Sharma_EDA.pdf 📄: A report with business insights derived from the EDA.
Deepakshi_Sharma_EDA.ipynb 💻: Jupyter Notebook with the EDA code.


Lookalike Model

Deepakshi_Sharma_Lookalike.csv 📈: A CSV file with recommended top 3 lookalike customers with similarity scores.
Deepakshi_Sharma_Lookalike.ipynb 💻: Jupyter Notebook explaining the model and its development.


Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

Deepakshi_Sharma_Clustering.pdf 📄: A detailed report on clustering results, DB index, and metrics.
Deepakshi_Sharma_Clustering.ipynb 💻: Jupyter Notebook containing the clustering code.


🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During the EDA phase, we analyzed the Customers, Products, and Transactions datasets to derive business insights such as:

Customer distribution across regions 🌍.
Product pricing trends 💵.
Transaction volumes and customer activity 📈.
Key insights from the EDA will guide the development of the lookalike model and clustering approach.

🤖 Lookalike Model

The Lookalike Model recommends 3 similar customers based on the user's profile and transaction history, helping businesses target the right audience for their marketing campaigns. 🧑‍💼✨

Top 3 lookalikes with similarity scores for each customer from C0001 to C0020 are included in the Lookalike.csv. 📊

📊 Customer Segmentation (Clustering)

We performed customer segmentation using K-Means Clustering. The results help in understanding customer behavior and targeting different segments with tailored strategies. 🎯

Key metrics included:

Number of Clusters: 4 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI): 0.745 🔍 (measuring the quality of clusters)
Cluster Distribution: Distribution of customers across clusters based on their profiles.
A summary of the clustering results is available in the ClusteringReport.txt and Clustering.pdf. 📑
